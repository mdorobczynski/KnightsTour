# KnightsTour

The program will do the following:

First: Ask the user for a starting position.
Second: Places the knight in that starting position and calculates all legal moves. Each move will be numbered.
Third: The user will choose a number and the knight will move to that space and recalculate the number of legal moves.
Fourth: With each move you will also give the user the option to either start a new game or exit the program.
Conclusion: The program ends when the user wishes.
